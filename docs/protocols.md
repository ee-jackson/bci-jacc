## _Jacaranda copaia_ transects
- find _Jacaranda copaia_ individual and place waypoint on GPS
- mark tree with flagging tape
- return to individual at later date and use the waypoint averaging function on the GPS to improve accuracy of co-ordinates
- take circumference measurement in mm and convert to DBH (`DBH = circumference / pi`)
- estimate crown radius as `r = 0.63 + (0.009 * DBH)` (see [here](../code/exploration/2022-10-11_estimate-crown.md/))
- estimate the centre of the crown and lay out four transects where distance = crown radius rounded up to the closest m
- one transect in each cardinal compass direction from the tree
  - if there is a large obstacle obstructing a large portion of the transect, shift the compass directions but maintain 90 deg between transects
- at each meter away from the tree lay out a 1m^2 quadrat so that the centre of the quadrat lines up with the meter mark
  - if there is a small obstacle obstructing the placement of a quadrat, move the quadrat along one side of the transect rather than in the centre
- in each quadrat count the number of:
  - open halves of _Jacaranda copaia_ seed pods
  - whole closed _Jacaranda copaia_ seed pods
  - halves of predated _Jacaranda copaia_ seed pods
- collect all pods in a bag and return to the lab
- in the lab measure the size of every seed pod lengthways using callipers
- alongside the length measurement, record whether the seed pod is: open/closed, half/whole and predated true/false
- if a seed pod is curved at an angle that is estimated to be equal to or greater than 140 degrees, measure the length of the pod with a piece of string in addition to with the calipers
