## _Jacaranda copaia_ transects
- find _Jacaranda copaia_ individual
- record DBH, co-ordinates
- mark tree with flagging tape and label
- ask GPS to do waypoint averaging
- take circumference measurement in mm and convert to DBH (`DBH = circumference / pi`)
- estimate crown radius as `r = 0.63 + (0.009 * DBH)`
- estimate the centre of the crown and lay out four transects where distance = crown radius rounded up to the closest m
- One transect in each cardinal compass direction from the tree
  - if there is a large obstacle obstructing the transect, shift the compass directions but maintain 90 deg between transects
- at each meter away from the tree lay out a 1m^2 quadrat so that the centre of the quadrat lines up with the meter mark
- in each quadrat count the number of:
  - open halves of _Jacaranda copaia_ seed pods
  - whole closed _Jacaranda copaia_ seed pods
  - whole predated _Jacaranda copaia_ seed pods
- collect all pods in a bag and return to the lab
- in the lab measure the size of every seed pod at the widest point using callipers
- if the open halves are connected / part of the same whole, copy the seed pod measurement exactly
