### EJ MG in field
* trialled protocols on trees 057 and 056
* this was the first time we used the tree allometry data to estimate crown radius as a basis for transect lengths
* for 056 we brought the pods back to the lab to measure and for 057 we measured pod size in the field
* decided that it was much easier and quicker to record pod size in the lab
