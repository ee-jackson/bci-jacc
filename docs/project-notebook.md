### EJ MG PC in field
* visited trees 063, 064, 065, 066, 067, 062, 061, 060

## 2022-10-26
### MG PC in field
* visited trees 037, 036, 038, 035, 034
* defined different pod morphotypes - from this point onwards we will classify pods into a morphotype and record this in the data sheet. At some point we will need to go back and classify the pods we have measured previously
* field collected data will continue to be recorded as simply open, closed or predated with predated pods being the `small_knobbly` and `single_locule` pod types

### EJ PC in field
* visited trees 049, 048, 047, 086, 019, 011

## 2022-10-24
### MG EJ in field
* visited trees 073, 020, 003, 002, 032

## 2022-10-23
### MG PC in field
* walked Shannon, Balboa
* visited trees 059, 081, 085, 080, 082, 084

## 2022-10-22
### EJ PC in field
* walked Schneirla, WMW, Balboa, AMNH, Wheeler
* visited trees 052, 051, 050, 053, 083, 054 

## 2022-10-21
### EJ MG in field
* walked Fairchild, Fausto, WMW, Donato
* visited trees 072, 071, 070, 069, 010, 058
* forgot to take the gps so will need to average waypoints for these individuals when visiting the exclusion experiment sites
* 058 was missing flagging tape

## 2022-10-13
### EJ MG in field
* trialled protocols on trees 057 and 056
* this was the first time we used the tree allometry data to estimate crown radius as a basis for transect lengths
* for 056 we brought the pods back to the lab to measure and for 057 we measured pod size in the field
* decided that it was much easier and quicker to record pod size in the lab

## 2022-09-28 to 2022-10-06
### EJ MG PC SG
* all BCI trails were walked and any _Jacaranda copaia_ sighted from trail were marked opportunistically
* additionally, maps of _Jacaranda_ individuals from Carol Garzon-Lopez were used to identify individuals which were approx 50m or less from the trail
* We trialled protocols on trees 001 and 004
