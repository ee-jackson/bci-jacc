### EJ MG in field
* walked Fairchild, Fausto, WMW, Donato
* visited trees 072, 071, 070, 069, 010, 058
* forgot to take the gps so will need to average waypoints for these individuals when visiting the exclusion experiment sites
* we couldn't find flagging tape for 058 - we found an individual in the vicinity of where 058 should be and sampled pods from that individual

### EJ MG in field
* trialled protocols on trees 057 and 056
* this was the first time we used the tree allometry data to estimate crown radius as a basis for transect lengths
* for 056 we brought the pods back to the lab to measure and for 057 we measured pod size in the field
* decided that it was much easier and quicker to record pod size in the lab

## 2022-09-28 to 2022-10-06
### EJ MG PC SG
* all BCI trails were walked and any _Jacaranda copaia_ sighted from trail were marked opportunistically
* additionally, maps of _Jacaranda_ individuals from Carol Garzon-Lopez were used to identify individuals which were approx 50m or less from the trail
* We trialled protocols on trees 001 and 004
