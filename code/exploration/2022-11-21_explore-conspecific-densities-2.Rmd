Ok, since we've now sampled 90 trees and added a few at v high and v low conspecific densities let's look again at the distribution of connectivity for our focal trees.

```{r packages}
library("tidyverse"); theme_set(theme_bw())
library("here")
library("sf")
library("ggmap")
```

## Read in gpx files

```{r read-gpx}
plotKML::readGPX(here::here("data", "raw", "Final_JACC_sites.gpx")) %>%
  map_df( ~ .) %>%
  rename(id = name) %>%
  arrange(id) %>%
  select(id, lon, lat) %>%
  filter(!grepl("NS", id)) -> focal_jacc

plotKML::readGPX(here::here("data", "maps",
                            "jacc-map-garzonlopez2012", "jac1co_map.gpx")) %>%
  map_df( ~ .) %>%
  select(lon, lat) %>%
  mutate(id = paste0("CGL", 1:n())) -> carol_jacc

rbind(carol_jacc, focal_jacc) -> all_jacc
```

## Calculate a simplified connectivity metric for all mapped _Jacaranda_ on BCI
 
First get distances between all trees.
 
```{r}

calculate_dist <- function (data) {

	data %>%
    select(lat, lon) -> plot_matrix

	rdist::pdist(plot_matrix[,c("lat", "lon")], 
	             metric = "euclidean") -> dists
	
	as.data.frame(dists) -> dists_df

	unlist(data$id) -> colnames(dists_df) 

	cbind(data, dists_df)
	
}

distance_df <- calculate_dist(all_jacc)

```

Then calculate the connectivity metric for each tree:

```{r}
all_jacc %>% 
  distinct(id) %>%
  pull(id) -> tree_id_list

calculate_connectivity <- function (data, tree_id) {
  data %>%
    group_by(id) %>%
    mutate(x = exp(- eval(parse(text = tree_id)) ) ) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    summarise(id = paste(tree_id),
              connectivity = sum(x), .groups = "drop")
}

connectivity_dfs <- lapply(tree_id_list,
                           calculate_connectivity, data = distance_df)

connectivity_dfs %>%
  lapply(drop_na, connectivity) %>%
  dplyr::bind_rows() -> all_connectivity_dfs

```

## Plot

```{r histogram}
all_connectivity_dfs %>%
  mutate(focal = grepl("EJJACC", id)) -> plot_dat

plot_dat %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = connectivity, fill = focal))

```

To compare, here is the histogram we plotted pre pod data collection:

It's not looking as good as we'd hoped. There is better covereage of the lower connectivities but still only a couple of trees sitting at the low end. There's a danger that we could end up with poor confidence in any regressions. 

```{r map}

bbox <- make_bbox(c(min(all_jacc$lon) - 0.001, max(all_jacc$lon) + 0.005), 
                  c(min(all_jacc$lat) - 0.005, max(all_jacc$lat) + 0.001))

bci_basemap <- ggmap::get_map(bbox, source = "stamen", 
                       force = TRUE, maptype = "toner-lite")

plot_data <- left_join(all_jacc, plot_dat, by = "id")

bci_basemap %>% 
  ggmap() +
  geom_point(data = filter(plot_data, focal == TRUE), 
             aes(x = lon, y = lat, size = connectivity),
             alpha = 0.7, shape =  16) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

Some of the individuals we picked up on Gross aren't looking as good as we'd hoped and we really struggled to find to find that low density point on T.Barbour but it looks like it's the lowest density one that we've got. Could be worth trying Miller again or North of T.Barbour.
