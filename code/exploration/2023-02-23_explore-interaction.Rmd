We found that the interaction between individual tree fecundity and connectivity 
had a likely positive effect on the rate of predispersal seed predation.

> An important concept of models with multiple predictors is interaction. 
> Interaction means that the effect of a predictor depends on the level of another predictor. 
> A little more technically, interaction is what is left over after the main effects of the factors are added: 
> interaction is the nonadditive influence of the factors.

from Doing Baysian Analysis by John Kruschke p.585

> I want to convince the reader that interaction effects are difficult to interpret. They are nearly impossible to interpret, using only posterior means and standard deviations. Once interactions exist, multiple parameters are in play at the same time.

Not very encouraging.. Let's explore.

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("here")
library("plotly")
library("reshape2")
library("brms")
```

```{r data}
readRDS(here::here("data", "clean", "connect_pod_data.rds"))  %>% 
  mutate(
    connectivity_sc = as.numeric(scale(connectivity)),
    individ_fecundity_sc = as.numeric(scale(individ_fecundity))
  ) %>%
  mutate(prop_predated = n_predated / n_total) %>%
  drop_na() -> model_data

model_fit <- readRDS(here::here("output", "models", "model_fit.rds"))

```

```{r conditional_effects}
plot(conditional_effects(model_fit,
                         effects = "connectivity_sc:individ_fecundity_sc", 
                         ndraws = 150, robust = TRUE))

plot(conditional_effects(model_fit,
                         effects = "individ_fecundity_sc:connectivity_sc", 
                         ndraws = 150, robust = TRUE))

```

In these plots the second predictor is depicted as three lines 
corresponding to its mean and its mean +/- one standard deviation.

The model believes that the effect of fecundity increases as 
connectivity increases.

Let's try one of those weird 3D plots.

This code is adapted from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50573936/r-how-to-change-color-of-plotly-3d-surface).

```{r plot_ly}
# using Gaussian because it's just easier for predicting
freq_mod <- glm(
  formula = prop_predated
  ~ connectivity_sc * individ_fecundity_sc,
  data = model_data
)

graph_reso <- 0.5
axis_x <- seq(min(model_data$individ_fecundity_sc), 
              max(model_data$individ_fecundity_sc), by = graph_reso)
axis_y <- seq(min(model_data$connectivity_sc), 
              max(model_data$connectivity_sc), by = graph_reso)

surface <- expand.grid(
  individ_fecundity_sc = axis_x,
  connectivity_sc = axis_y,
  KEEP.OUT.ATTRS = F
)

surface$prop_predated <- predict(freq_mod, newdata = surface)

surface_plot <- acast(surface, connectivity_sc ~ 
                        individ_fecundity_sc, value.var = "prop_predated")

p <- plot_ly(data = model_data) %>%
  add_trace(
    x = ~individ_fecundity_sc, y = ~connectivity_sc, z = ~prop_predated,
    type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers",
    opacity = .8
  ) %>% 
  add_trace(
    z = surface_plot,
    x = axis_x,
    y = axis_y,
    opacity = .8,
    type = "surface", colorscale = list(c(0, 1), c("tan", "blue"))
  )

```

This is nice to play with interactively, but don't think it'll work so well as a 
flat plot.
